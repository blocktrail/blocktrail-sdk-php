IMPORTANT! FLOATS ARE EVIL!!
----------------------------
As is best practice with financial data, The API returns all values as an integer, the Bitcoin value in Satoshi's.
**In PHP even more than in other languages it's really easy to make mistakes whem converting from float to integer etc!**

When doing so it's really important that you use the `bcmath` or `gmp` libraries to avoid weird rounding errors!
The BlockTrail SDK has some easy to use functions to do this for you, we recommend using these
and we also **strongly** recommend doing all Bitcoin calculation and storing of data in integers
and only convert to/from Bitcoin float values for displaying it to the user.

```php
use Blocktrail\SDK\BlocktrailSDK;

echo "123456789 Satoshi to BTC: " . BlocktrailSDK::toBTC(123456789) . " \n";
echo "1.23456789 BTC to Satoshi: " . BlocktrailSDK::toSatoshi(1.23456789) . " \n";

```

A bit more about this can be found [in our documentation](https://www.blocktrail.com/api/docs/php#api_coin_format).

Requirements
------------
The SDK requires PHP 5.4+ and the Intl, GMP, BCMath and Mcrypt PHP extensions.  
To install these on Ubuntu use:
```
sudo apt-get install php5-intl php5-gmp php5-mcrypt
sudo php5enmod mcrypt
```
*BCMath should already be part of the default php5 package*

Installation
------------
To install the SDK, you will need to be using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) in your project.
If you aren't using Composer yet, it's really simple! Here's how to install composer and the BlockTrail PHP SDK.

```
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

# Add the BlockTrail SDK as a dependency
php composer.phar require blocktrail/blocktrail-sdk
``` 

Next, require Composer's autoloader, in your application, to automatically load the BlockTrail SDK in your project:
```PHP
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Blocktrail\SDK\BlocktrailSDK;
```

Or if put the following in your `composer.json`:
```
"blocktrail/blocktrail-sdk": "1.1.*"
```
