BlockTrail PHP SDK Changelog
============================

v2.0.0
------
 - New [Default] Wallet Version 2
 - `BackupGenerator` now supports `$extra` to be printed on document for extra notes
 - No longer support `BackupGenerator::generateImage`

### Upgrade / BC breaks
 - `createNewWallet` now returns `list($wallet, $backupInfo)` to be able to support both v1 and v2
 - `new BackupGenerator()` now takes `$identifier, $backupInfo, $extra`
 - No longer support `BackupGenerator::generateImage`
 - `WalletSweeper` has changed to remove some abstraction, also added insight-api implementation

### New [Default] Wallet Version 2
Instead of using `BIP39`, wallet seeds will now be stored encrypted - to allow for password changes

Wallet Creation:  
```
primarySeed = random()
secret = random()
primaryMnemonic = BIP39.entropyToMnemonic(AES.encrypt(primarySeed, secret))
secretMnemonic = BIP39.entropyToMnemonic(AES.encrypt(secret, password))
```

Wallet Init:  
```
secret = BIP39.entropyToMnemonic(AES.decrypt(secretMnemonic, password))
primarySeed = BIP39.entropyToMnemonic(AES.decrypt(primaryMnemonic, secret))
```

See `docs/KEYS.md` for more info
   
Old Wallets that are v1 will remain so and will continue working.

v1.3.7
------
 - updated Guzzle to `v5.3.1` to fix a php7.1 bug.

v1.3.6
------
 - Updated TransactionBuilder to be more customizable
 - add $wallet->getMaxSpendable
 - add fee strategies

v1.3.2
------
 - set `DUST` to 2730 satoshis, to reflect a 0.00005 BTC/kb relay fee, which many people still use to avoid spam.

v1.3.1
------
 - add `Wallet::FEE_STRATEGY_LOW_PRIORITY` which should give a 75% chance to get into the next 3 blocks.

v1.3.0
------
 - Floating Fees

### Floating Fees
To deal with stresstests etc. there's now a `feePerKB` method to get the optimal fee and the `$wallet->pay` has a `$feeStrategy` argument.  
When `$feeStrategy` is `Wallet::FEE_STRATEGY_OPTIMAL` (default) it will use the (by the API calculated) optimal fee per KB.  
When `$feeStrategy` is `Wallet::FEE_STRATEGY_BASE_FEE` it will use the BASE_FEE of 0.0001 BTC per KB and use the old way of rounding the transaction size to 1 KB.

For using the `TransactionBuilder` use the `$txBuilder->setFeeStrategy()` if you don't want the default `Wallet::FEE_STRATEGY_OPTIMAL`.

Optimal fee is calculated by taking all transactions from the last 30 blocks and calculating what the lowest possible fee is 
that still gives more than 75% chance to end up in the next block.

v1.2.17
-------
 - Add support to `TransactionBuilder` for OP_RETURN, see `examples/op_return_payment_api_example.php`

v1.2.16
-------
 - Improved fee estimation

v1.2.15
-------

v1.2.14
-------

 - add `TransactionBuilder` class to construct custom transactions
 - add `forceFee` to `pay`
 - allow different ways of specifying outputs for `wallet->pay`
